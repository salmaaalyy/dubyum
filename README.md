# dubYum
Having a hard time finding you favorite cultural foods near UW? Well DubYum is here for you! Find your home away from home with a simple search! 

## Inspiration
As college students, we've struggled with finding cultural comfort foods near campus. Relying on word of mouth for recommendations can get pretty tiresome and searching for options online can yield hundreds of results. We wanted an easier alternative to be able to search and filter restaurants based on our wants and needs, keep track of where you've been eating, and making friends with other foodies!
## What it does
**dubYum** is a platform where students can find their next cultural food recommendation and vote on their favorite restaurants near the University of Washington campus. Users can create their profile and find other foodies to befriend, making long-lasting relationships.
## How we built it
**dubYum** was built using HTML/CSS for the frontend, a mix of JavaScript and Node backend, and SQL database.
